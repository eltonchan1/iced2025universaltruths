<br>
We are a group of students from Sir Winston Churchill Secondary working on a project called I.C.E.D. (Initiate, Coalesce, Express, Do).
<br>
Each group comes up with an open ended question and attempts to answer it.
<br>
Our question is: "How can we move beyond our own perspectives to discover a universal truth?"
<br>
For our "Do" component we created a survey to try and see if there even is a universal truth.
<br>
This website was made to share our survey as well as the results of it.
<br>
Thank you to everyone that completed the survey and we hope you learn something new from our results!
