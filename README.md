We are a group of students from Sir Winston Churchill Secondary working on a project called I.C.E.D. (Initiate, Coalesce, Express, Do).
Each group comes up with an open ended question and attempts to answer it.
Our question is: "How can we move beyond our own perspectives to discover a universal truth?"
For our "Do" component we created a survey to try and see if there even is a universal truth.
This website was made to share our survey as well as the results of it.
Thank you to everyone that completed the survey and we hope you learn something new from our results!
